# Integrations Page - DEPRECATED

⚠️ **This page has been merged with the Channels page.**

Please use `/channels` instead, which now includes both:
- Channel connections (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- OAuth configurations for each platform

## Migration
- All OAuth configuration functionality is now available in the Channels page
- Users can configure OAuth credentials and connect channels in one place
- The navigation has been updated to point to `/channels`

## Why the merge?
- Better user experience: configure and connect in one place
- Reduced navigation complexity
- Clearer workflow: configure OAuth → connect channel
