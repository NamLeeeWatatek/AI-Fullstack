## 📊 APPENDIX: OBJECTION HANDLING

### Common Objections & Responses:

#### **"We already have a chatbot"**
**Response**: 
"That's great! Most of our customers had chatbots before switching to WataOmi. The difference is:
- Our AI is 3x more accurate (95% vs 65%)
- We're all-in-one (no need for 5 different tools)
- Better ROI ($499 vs $2,500/month for similar features)

Would you be open to a side-by-side comparison?"

#### **"It's too expensive"**
**Response**:
"I understand budget is important. Let's look at the ROI:
- You're currently spending $X on support team

- That's a 1,600% ROI

Can we do a quick ROI calculation for your business?"

**Response**:
"Implementation takes just 30 minutes of your time:
- We handle the technical setup
- Pre-built templates for your industry

Would you like to see our implementation timeline?"

- Bot handles routine questions (80%)
- Humans focus on complex issues (20%)
- Seamless handoff when needed
- Customers get faster responses (2min vs 12hr)

Your team becomes more productive, not replaced."

#### **"What if the AI gives wrong answers?"**
**Response**:
"Great question! We have multiple safeguards:
